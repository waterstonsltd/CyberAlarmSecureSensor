This is the initial version of the Police CyberAlarm Secure Sensor.

Currently we support:

- Cisco ASA routers
- Fortinet FortiGate routers

More will be added in the future, and we welcome contributions from the community to expand our support for additional router models and brands. If you have a router that you would like to see supported, please reach out to us with details about the model and its capabilities.
